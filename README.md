## WELCOME:


This is the README.md for the Team Runtime-Terror's Project One titled: <i>Daily Delight</i>

From scratch we are to build a website utilizing two third-party APIs.

We are making an app that recommends drinks based on the local weather conditions.

## HOW TO:

Search your city by name in the side bar. Your local weather will be run through our proprietary hyper-detailed algorithm to give you the perfect cocktail for those weather conditions!
